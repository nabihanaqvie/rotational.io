## The World of Immersive Technology

Entering the era of immersive technology, there are many terminologies that are thrown around describing the experience. The most used are Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality(AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). VR is computer generated, where the user is completely immersed into the digital world. Oculus, a gaming console, is probably the most well-known device for VR experience. AR can be described as a semi-immersive experience, where it enhances the real world. Pokemon Go is a great example of AR technology, where the digital world meets the real world through an interface. Lastly, MR allows the users to interact with virtual objects in the real world; if you remember the failure that was Google Glass, that's MR.[^1]

To get a better understanding of VR, this article will focus on the gaming industry, since it has  fully adopted the VR experience as its newest born offspring. This experience is usually comprised of a headset and controllers. Other accessories can be added, such as a multi-directional treadmill, for a better experience. Oculus let's you have a immersive experience for the price of $399 per set (depending what storage you buy) and a powerful PC.[^2] 
 
So what can you expect from a VR experience? 

As a gamer, my first experience into the VR world was through completing an Assasin Creed escape room at VR Zone DC. I was fully emersed into the intricate graphic design, where I really felt like I was in the game. Although I noticed some limitation quite soon, such as lack of moveability, I was still in awe with the level of graphics detail. My expectations after the escape room was sky high, I was ready to come back again; and I did to the VR Arcade. Unfortunately, my experience with VR Arcade was quite underwhelming. The games lacked good graphics and playability was extremely low. I was disappointed.  

## Failures 

Getting immersive technologies to break in to the consumer market has been difficult. A multitude of products have tried and failed for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most famous example is Google Glass. Marketed for daily life utility, the product did not appeal to its intended audience and failed to create any semblence of a consumer base beyond a few industrial uses.[^3] Google Glass failed for many reasons, among which was the fact that $1500 for ambiguous amounts of additional value was an uninteresting value proposition for its audience. Immersive technologies have also encountered difficulty in creating a seamless experience that the public seems to now expect. An example of what glitched gaming looks like can be found in the following link: (The following link contains profanity) https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/55iwxo/glitches_in_vr_are_terrifying/. With the glorious graphics available in films, monitor/tv-based video games, and even mobile devices, the limited graphic level in most VR games and applications feels like a step into the past in some ways. Immersive experiences seem to be dealing with a new type of issue, where the consumers expect a polished experience before buying in.

Although it seems like some initiatives have begun to change the narrative. Recently, we saw the explosion of Pokemon Go into the mobile gaming industry that also attracted many users that had never before participated in that market. Pokemon Go offered ease of use and simplicity that took advantage of the powerful hardware already present in mobile devices. The financial barrier of entry was also close to nonexistent; anyone with a touchscreen phone could download and run the game. Similarly, Oculus has seemed be the first mainstream VR system. Compared to the HTC Vive, Playstation VR, and Valve Index VR systems that price at $600, $900, and $2000, the Oculus Quest 2's entry price of $300 dollars is much more appealing. This is especially true for anyone who already owns a home desktop system with a dedicated graphics card (which became even more common with the growth of work-from-home during the pandemic). The Oculus experience also addresses many issues that affected the "polish" levels expected by consumers by, for example, being a wireless console.

Despite the immersive technologies continuing to improve, some issues remain. One issue that Rotational Labs is interested in addressing is data storage and transfer speeds limiting the immersive experience.

## How Data Continues to be the Limiting Factor for Immersive Technology
 
Andrew Ross in his article, "Solving the virtual reality storage challenge" states the following: 

> The ideal scenario for storing VR data must be one that enables organisations to access and edit their VR files as necessary, while also allowing them to economically archive them, thereby protecting and preserving data for as long as is needed.[^4]

Since playing VR games involves a lot of interactions, the read and write times should allow for durability, availability and scalability. Any disruptions in the data read and write speeds will cause an jagged interruption to the VR experience. As mentioned above, VR requires a powerful PC, so let's think about data storage at a primary level.[^5] Choosing the right hardware such as HDDs v SDDs as well as understanding how different components impact the Data Transfer Rate (DTR), allows us to create an environment with better data flow.    

## Future Steps

At Rotational Labs, we are interested in dissecting the VR world from different perspectives. How are people handling the overlap between VR and physical reality? What assumptions do people have with "new technology"? And, how can we use distributed systems to understand the failures of VR?
